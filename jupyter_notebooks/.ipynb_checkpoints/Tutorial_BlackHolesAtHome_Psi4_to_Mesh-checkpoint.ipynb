    "The purpose of this notebook is to outline and demonstrate the process of converting psi4 data into a folder of time dependent `.vtk` mesh files. It is important for the psi4 data to be extrapolated to time dependent xyz in order to generate a mesh from spherical or catesian coordinates in either two or three dimentions. Once a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) has been applied to psi4, yielding strain against time, several different directions can be taken. This notebook examines the use of  FFT in conjunction with spherical harmonics and a time interpolation to produce a time dependent mesh ranging from radius 100 to 2000. The following steps were used:"
