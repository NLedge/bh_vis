    "# Start to Finish Example: BBH Merger From $\\psi_4$ Data to MP4 Movie\n",
    "\n",
    "## Author: Tyndale Stutzman, Seth Winchell\n",
    "\n",
    "## This tutorial provides an overview of how to take primitive binary black hole merger data ($\\psi_4$) and visualize it as an MP4 movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction: \n",
    "\n",
    "Among a plethora of data produced by the Black Holes At Home (BH@H) project, $\\psi_4$ data is the most valuable for visualization purposes as it contains information regarding gravitational wave strain, $\\textit{h}$. The purpose of this notebook is to provide a general example of extracting $\\textit{h}$ from $\\psi_4$, creating a series of meshes, and finally animating these meshes along with their constituent black holes in a final, downloadable movie that can then be edited in post. As such, this tutorial is not in depth, however, links to more detailed notebooks can be found in certain sections. \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- note to anyone reading this... do we need more of a casual introduction here? How much do we talk about it vs diving in? Thanks. -->\n",

    "### Prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before continuing in this tutorial, if you do not already have VisIt installed on your local system, refer to [**Tutorial_BlackHolesAtHome_PythonToVisIt**](Tutorial_BlackHolesAtHome_PythonToVisIt.ipynb) for a guide to setting up VisIt and interfacing via Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended:\n",
    "\n",
    "While the following references are not critical to producing a movie given BH@H data, they provide valuable insight into the underlying concepts behind each step in this overview. <!-- redundant? -->\n",

    "<!-- stupid question but I'm assuming I can't use visit all packaged up in the notebook, right? -->\n",
